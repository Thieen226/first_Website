            <p>
                John Wick is an assassin but he is retired due to personal issues.
                However, someone messes up with him which annoys him and he is trying to kill them. 
                The movies contain a lot of fighting scenes so I want to warn you before watching this.
                Overall, the movies are really good and make your heart rise when the fighting begins.

            <p>
                This is a psychological horror, where the dad gets remarried with another woman  which makes the sisters' mom kill herself.
                The sisters ignore and hate the stepmother but then weird things begin to happen in their house.
                Many argue that the dad's actions are the cause that make their family break apart.

                The name of the movie may make you think it is about a disease. 
                However, it is not what you think at all.
                The movie presents a desire of humans when it comes to money. 
                This movie makes me think about how powerful an action of person can make thing worse that I cannot imagine.
